# Librivox Audiobook Player
[Librivox](https://librivox.org/) is a website that provides public domain audiobooks. My main goal is to make a cross-platform app that allows you to add an audiobook to your library and sync your listening position across devices. 

The core of the project is very similar to [this repository](https://github.com/lohanidamodar/flutter_audiobooks_app/) (though I am starting from scratch). My goal is to make something similar to that, plus:
* User authentication (using Firebase or something similar)
* Enabling a web version
* Syncing current position in the audiobook across devices
* Layout improvements (in general, and for the audio player widget)
